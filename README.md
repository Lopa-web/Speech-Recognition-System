"DESCRIPTION":This project implements a Speech Recognition System using Python and the SpeechRecognition library. It captures audio input from a microphone, processes it, and converts it into text using Google Speech Recognition API.
Features:Uses a microphone to capture real-time audio input.
Adjusts for ambient noise to improve accuracy.
Processes speech input and converts it into text output.
Handles errors gracefully (e.g., unclear speech, connectivity issues).
Provides real-time transcription for spoken words.
Workflow:Initialize the recognizer (sr.Recognizer()).
Capture audio input from the microphone (sr.Microphone()).
Adjust for ambient noise to filter background interference.
Listen and record audio (recognizer.listen()).
Transcribe audio to text using Google Speech Recognition API.
Display transcribed text or handle exceptions if speech is unclear.
Deliverable:A Python script that allows real-time speech-to-text conversion. Users can speak into the microphone, and the system will transcribe their speech into text and display it in the console.
